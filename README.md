2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the dataset (see [Data](#data) section) and place it in the `data` directory.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

cd King-County-Housing-Market-Model

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook final_lr.ipynb

This will open the notebook in your browser.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to analyze the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains historical housing data for the King County area. It includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and location information.

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [[source_link].](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)

## Model

The prediction model is based on a linear regression algorithm. It is trained on the historical housing data to learn the relationships between the input features and housing prices. The model can then be used to make predictions on new data.
